    "damages": [
      "Newly hatched larvae feed on the leaves causing pin-head size holes while the 2nd to early 3rd instar larvae produce match-head size holes or as big as shot holes.",
      "Infestation starts 4 weeks after planting and lasts until harvest.",
      "At tasseling stage high larval population results to clumping and subsequent breakage of tassels.",
      "The 4th instar larvae caused the greatest damage since they feed on the silk, enter the developing ear and late bore deeper into the cob.",
      "Yield losses are greatest when damage occurs at the reproductive stages.",
      "Late-instar larvae bore into the stem or branches of host plants or webbed groups of florets and branches. They bore in the shank and cob in the ear or feed in silk or kernels. The stalk is the most common feeding site for final-instar larvae."

          "Sanitation: Cut and burn straw piles after a corn stem borer (CSB) infestation. Burn or bury removed tassels or give them to farm animals as feed.",
